## Fully updated
All models and methods are automatically generated and updated from official BotAPI documentation.

## Built-in dispatcher and smart handlers
Built-in dispatcher for Webhook updates and ability to load handler files from a directory.

## Fast and Async
This wrapper uses `orjson`, which is a much faster Cython json utility. Every method is fully async, with `httpx`.

## Other...
* Easy and accurata type hintings
* Handlers decorators
* Global parameters (e.g.: `parse_mode`)

## TODO
- [ ] Bound methods
- [ ] More costumization
- [ ] Improved dispatcher and built-in support for `getUpdates`
